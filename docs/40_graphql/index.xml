      <description>Now that we have authenticated users, let&amp;rsquo;s make an API for creating albums. These albums won&amp;rsquo;t have any photos in them just yet, just a name and an association with the username that created them, but it&amp;rsquo;s another clear step toward putting our app together.
To build our API we&amp;rsquo;ll use AWS AppSync, a managed GraphQL service for building data-driven apps. If you&amp;rsquo;re not yet familiar with the basics of GraphQL, you should take a few minutes and check out https://graphql.</description>

      <description>Open the AWS Console and click into the photoalbums API. Now we can start poking around with the API.

  Click Queries in the sidebar on the left.
This area is AWS AppSync&amp;rsquo;s interactive query explorer. We can write queries and mutations here, execute them, and see the results. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to test things out to make sure our resolvers are working the way we expect.</description>
