## AWS Amplify와 AWS AppSync로  <br/> 사진 공유 웹 어플리케이션 구현 

### 환영합니다!

<p style='text-align: left;'>
    In this workshop, we'll use React to build a data-driven web app that lets users upload to shared, secure photo galleries. We'll use AWS AppSync to get up and running quickly with a GraphQL API that backs our data in Amazon DynamoDB. In addition, we'll demonstrate how to use the AWS Amplify library to authenticate users, communicate with our API, and manage photo uploads. Finally, we add in AI-powered object tagging using Amazon Rekognition, allowing users to discover photos without any manual data entry.
