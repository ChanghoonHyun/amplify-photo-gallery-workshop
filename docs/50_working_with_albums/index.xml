      <description>At this point, we have a web app that authenticates users and a secure GraphQL API endpoint that lets us create and read Album data. It&amp;rsquo;s time to connect the two together!

We&amp;rsquo;ll start by using its Connect React component to take care of automatically querying our GraphQL API and providing data for our React components to use when rendering.</description>
