We'll need a place to store all of the photos that get uploaded to our albums. Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a great option for this and Amplify's Storage module makes setting up and working with S3 very easy.

### Configuring and adding storage

First, we'll use the Amplify CLI to enable storage for our app. This will create a bucket on Amazon S3 and set it up with appropriate permissions so that users who are logged in to our app can read from and write to it. 


1. **From the photo-albums directory, run** `amplify add storage`

2. **Select 'Content'** at the prompt

3. **Enter values or accept defaults** for the resource category and bucket name

4. Configure it so that **only authenticated users** have access with **read/write permissions**. 

    Here is sample output with responses:

    ```text
    $ amplify add storage


    ? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: 

    Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)


    ? Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project: 

    photoalbumsstorage


    ? Please provide bucket name: 

    <accept the default value>


    ? Who should have access: 

    Auth users only


    ? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users: 

    read/write
    ```

Now we'll have Amplify modify our cloud environment, provisioning the storage resources we just added.

1. **Run** `amplify push` 
2. **Press Enter** to confirm the changes
3. Wait for the provisioning to finish. Adding storage usually only takes a minute or two.
